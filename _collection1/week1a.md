DES Test


Week 1

**Practice Questions**

**1.** Ethylene oxide, C2H4O, decomposes when heated to give methane and carbon monoxide.
 C2H4O (g)  CH4 (g) + CO (g)
 The following kinetic data were observed for the reaction at 688 K:

| **Experiment** | **Initial Concentration of Ethylene Oxide (M)** | **Initial Rate (M/s)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.00272 | 5.57 x 10-7 |
| 2 | 0.00544 | 1.11 x 10-6 |

Find the rate law and the value of the rate constant for this reaction.

**2.** The decomposition of N2O5 to NO2 and O2 is first order, with a rate constant of 4.80 x 10-4sec-1 at 45°C.

1. If the initial concentration is 1.65 x 10-2 mol/L, what is the concentration after 825s?
2. How long would it take for the concentration of N2O5 to decrease to 1.00 x 10-2 mol/L from its initial value given in (a)?

**3.** Cyclopropane, C3H6, is converted to its isomer propylene, CH2=CHCH3, when heated. The rate law is first order in cyclopropane, and the rate constant is 6.0 x 10-4/s at 500°C. If the initial concentration of cyclopropane is 0.0226 mol/L, what is the concentration after 899 s?

 NO2Cl NO2 + Cl (slow step)
NO2Cl + Cl NO2 + Cl2 (fast step)

1. Identify the reaction intermediate.
2. What is the overall reaction?
3. What rate law is predicted by this mechanism?

**5.** A second-order reaction has a rate constant of 8.7 x 10-4/(M s) at 30°C. At 40°C, the rate constant is 1.8 x 10-3/(M s). What are the activation energy and frequency factor for this reaction? Predict the value of the rate constant at 45°C.
